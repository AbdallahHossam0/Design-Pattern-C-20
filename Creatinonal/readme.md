# Creational Design Patterns

Creational Design Patterns are a set of software design patterns that provide solutions to object creation problems in software development. These patterns help in creating objects in a way that is more flexible, efficient, and extensible than traditional object creation methods.

## This directory has 4 Creational Design pattern:

### 1- Builder Design Pattern
Builder design pattern is usually used for complex objects. This pattern helps the developer to construct the object step by step.

### 2- Factory Method Pattern
Factory Method Pattern encapsulates object creation logic in a separate class, which simplifies code and improves maintainability.

### 3- Prototype Design Pattern
Prototype Design Pattern is usually used when the cost of creating a new object is high. So, to create new object we just copy an existing object(prototype) and modify it to satisfy our needs.

### 4- Singleton Design Pattern
Singleton Design Pattern is used when you only need an individual object on your whole object or an individual object per thread. It is useful for creating databases and thread pool. But it is the most hated design pattern!!, so stop using it in new projects as it complicate the unit testing and create dependencies between different parts on your system.
